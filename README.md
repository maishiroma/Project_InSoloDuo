# Overview
- This game originally started out as a demo for the final project for the Introduction to Vieo Game Design class at the USC Summer Programs, only spanning 1/3 of the first stage of the first world. After turning in the project, I wanted to add more to the game, turning it into something closer to what I originally envisioned it. So, here's the final results after three years: a completed adventure that has five worlds, each with two levels.

# Main Gameplay
- The player controls Gale, a teenager who has the ability to change his gender, which grants him different abilities. 
  - Male Gale can run, stomp on enemies, and shoulder tackle breakable walls. However, he will fall through breakable floors and has a short jump.
  - Female Gale moves slower, but in return, has a bigger jump. She can also twirl to attack enemies as well as slightly hover in midair. She also has a fireball attack that allows her to hit enemies and switches from afar.

# NOTE
- Unfortunatly, in the most up to date version of GameMaker, the source code no longer can compile due to deprecated function calls. So this code will not run in the newest version of GameMaker, but the .exe of the game still works regardless. In the future, I will edit the code so that the game can be sucessfully played and tested in the newest version of GameMaker.
