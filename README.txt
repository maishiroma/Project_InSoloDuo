1.) Welcome
-Hello person! Yes, YOU! Thank you for taking the time to play this game! This game is fairly short; it can be completed in roughly 30 mins to an hour, maybee even less if you're a speed runner. This game is one of my very first projects, so if there's unexpected glitches, errors, or lag, don't mind it too much. IF you have any sugesstions for the game, feel free to make a video of this or message me if you know me personally. Once again, thank you for puting some time aside to trying out this short but sweet experience!

2.) Story
-Dr. Die, a mad scientist who sought out to make the world his own creation, managed to get what he wanted after researching for over two decades.Coined Project A, it was his long dream goal to transform the world into an animationart. However, disaster struck as upon activation, the world balance went up into flames, litelerally. People began to act strange, abnormal creatures and land masses suddenly roamed the lands. In this mess, a teenager named Gale was trying to live his normal life when he was struck by a strange beam, one side effect of the experiment. Afterwards, Gale noticed that he can shape shift into the oppsoite gender! Weirded out, Gale headed out on a walk until he noticed that for some odd reason, he can't see his own home anymore. With nowhere to go, Gale sough out one way he knows best: forward. 

3.) Controls
- Right/Left arrows: Move
- Up arrow: Enter doors
- Down arrow: Drop through certain platforms
- Space: Jump*
- A key: Gender Ability*
- S Key: Gender Skill*
- D: Shapeshift**

*These abilities change depending if Gale is a male or female!
**After changing gender, the gender bar (located on the top middle of the screen) depleats. Gale can't change gender again until this meter fills up again. IT's also important to note that Gale can only shapeshift when he's on the ground.

4.) Gender Abilities
-When Gale changes genders, the abilities available to Gale change drastically! This can lead to new ways to traverse the lands as well as what Gale can do as well!

CAUTION: A and S key actions have a cool down to them! Once a gender action is used, no other gender actions can be used for a short time!

Male Gale:
- Skills: 
	- A Key (Dash): While Gale is moving, press and/hold A to make Gale quickly speed up for a short disitance. This move is great for covering large distances ina short time.
	- S Key: (Shoulder Slam): While Gale is moving, press S to make Gale charge into objects with his shoulder. This move is a nifty attacking option to defeating enemies as well as breaking cracked walls.

- Special Traits:
	- Male Gale moves around quickly and has a faster jump. However, male Gale can't jump as high as a result. 
	- Male Gale has the unique ability todefeat enemies by stomping on them. He can also bounce off of them to gain even more height!
	- If Male Gale jumps and performs a Dash, the amount of horizontal disitance he covers in the jump greatly increases!
	- Male Gale is the only one that can use springs, but in return, some platforms collapse if Male Gale steps on them!

Female Gale:
- Skills:
	- A Key (Tornado Twirl): While moving, pressand hold A for Female Gale to spin around like crazy. She can wipe out enemies just by touching them. 
	- S Key (FireBall): While moving, press S and Female Gale will shoot a fireball in the direction she is facing. This fireball devestates faraway foes as well as having the ability to activate faraway switches!

- Special Traits: 
	- Female Gale is not as fast in movement speed, but in return, she has an AMAZING vertical jump.
	- If Female Gale performs the Tornado Twirl in midair, she will do a slight double jump attack! This can allow her to just barely reach some heights as well as extending her jump length!
	- Female Gale is more floaty than Male Gale, meaning she not only can stand on some platforms, but she also has an easier time landing after jumps! She can't use springs as a result though.

5.) Basic GamePlay
- The goal of the game is to head to the goal doors to clear the stage! In the stages, Gale has to navigate the tricky platforms and obstacles by using gender swapping! 

Main Screen GUI: 
	- Health: Gale's health is measured in feelings. It starts off as "GREAT!", and as Gale takes a hit from enemies, it goes down to "Fine", "Ack..." and "Ok". After taking one more hit when the health shows "OK", Gale 	loses a life.
	- Time: The amount of time to beat a stage. Once it runs out, Gale is forced to restart the current world and loses a life in the process. 
	- Stars: Currently how many stars Gale has collected.
	- Lives: The amount of lives/retrys Gale has. Once this runs past 0, it's game 	over! 

Level Gimmicks:
	- Stars: Scattered through the levels are these stars! Collet them to boost your score. For every fifth star, Gale get's an extra life!
	- Clocks: These helpful items increase the time on the counter. 
	- Extra Life: These give Gale an extra life!
	- Signs: These remind you of helpful tips!
	- Flags: These act as checkpoints in a level! Once Gale dies, he is either warped back to the start of the current room or at the last flag he passed!
	- Switches: These come in yellow or red variety. Yellow act as timed events where yellow switch blocks dissapear and hidden red blocks appear for a short time! Listen to the music and plan accordingly! Red switches bring back special platfroms back to where the switch is located.
	-Springs: These green spring boards propel Male gale high into the air! But Female Gale simply passes through them...
	-White clouds: These soft clouds crumble if Male Gale stands a single foot on them. But Female Gale can tread on these with no problem...
	- Spikes: Ouch! Hitting these damages Gale! Avoid them!
	- Pits: BEWARE! If Gale falls off the level, he loses a life!
	- Brown Doors: These doors take Gale to a hidden room or to another location in the level! Mysterious...
	- Portals: These teleport Gale to the next part of the level!
	- Goal Doors These are the end gates of a level! Enter them to clear the level!

Enemies:
	-Zombies: These crazy humans have gone berserk over the new world! They simply 	patrol an area.
	-Slimes: Creepy green ooze that formed from the radiation from the experiments. They hop around, making them slightly harder to deal with. 
	- Flying Mushroom: These annoying pesks float around. Any attack can take them out.
	- Purple Flies: These guys are invincible, due to that purple mist that cloaks them. Be careful!
	- Cannons: These come in two varieties. One of them shoots bullets that cannot be destroyed, but can be bounced off on by Male Gale. The other one shoots FIRE which is obviuously painful. Watch their patterns!
	- Fire Shooters: Like cannons, these shoot exclusively flames vertically. They can also move at the same time! It's safe to stand on them when there's nothing firing...
	- Pink Disk: These odd things float mindlessly in the air. Touching them hurts, but Male Gale can use them as movable springs!

6.) Tips and Tricks
- Take advantage of the increasing dificulty by collecting as many stars early in the game! You'll be needing those lives because once your lives go past 0, you have to restart the entire game!
- Usually there's multiple paths in a level. The more dangerousone tends to have better goodies than the safer route.
- If there's a switch near a seemingly empty area, be prepared for a timed sequence! Speed is the essence!
- Collcting stars is the best way to get a great score! Just don't die in a level, since that will reset your star counter back to zero!
